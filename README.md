# PureTemplate

This fork of [StringTemplate](https://github.com/antlr/stringtemplate4) has the following goals:

* Provide a more modern API
* Fix bugs and make improvements in a way that StringTemplate could not do without sacrificing backwards compatibility
* Rigidly encapsulate implementation details to reduce constraints on future evolution such as adding thread safety
* Modernize the original Java 6 code base to take advantage of and offer support for newer Java language versions
* Enforce strict model-view separation just like StringTemplate does
* Keep the StringTemplate language unchanged


## Current status

Work in progress.
